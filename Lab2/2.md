Let us continue with Lab2 using the same dataset (Superstore).

You can continue in the same worksheet as used for Lab1.


### ✅ **Report 1: Sales by State (Map View)**

**Objective**: Visualize geographical sales performance.

**Steps**:
1. Create a new worksheet and name it **Sales by State Map**.
2. Drag `State` to **Rows** (Tableau will recognize it as a geographic field).
3. Drag `Sales` to **Color** and **Label** on the Marks card.
4. Change the Marks type to **Map**.
5. Use the **Color Legend** to highlight states with high and low sales.
6. Add `Category` as a filter if you want users to view map sales per category.

### ✅ **Report 6: Top 10 Customers by Profit**

**Objective**: Identify customers contributing the most profit.

**Steps**:
1. Create a new worksheet called **Top 10 Customers**.
2. Drag `Customer Name` to **Rows**.
3. Drag `Profit` to **Columns`.
4. Sort by descending order of Profit.
5. Drag `Profit` to **Label** to show values.
6. Use the **Top N Filter**:

   - Go to **Top** tab > Select **By field**: Top 10 by Sum of Profit.
7. Optional: Add `Customer Segment` to color or filter.

### ✅ **Dashboard Creation: Lab 1 Dashboard**

Let’s combine all visualizations into a dashboard.

**Steps**:

2. Drag the following worksheets onto the dashboard:
   - Sales by Category
   - Profit by Region
   - Quantity by Segment
   - Sales vs. Profit
   - Sales by State Map
   - Top 10 Customers
3. Use **Tiled layout** for neat alignment.
4. Add **Filters** or **Highlight Actions**:
   - Example: Click a Category in “Sales by Category” to highlight items in other views.
