Alright! Let's begin by designing **Lab 1: Creating Your First Interactive Report in Tableau** using the provided Superstore data.

## üìò **Lab 1: Creating Your First Interactive Report - Sales Overview**

### Objective:
In this lab, you will:
- Connect Tableau to the Superstore dataset
- Create an interactive report showing Sales, Profit, and Quantity by Category and Region
- Add basic interactivity (filter, tooltip, and formatting)

---

### ‚úÖ **Step 1: Open Tableau and Connect to Data**

1. Open **Tableau Desktop**.
2. From the home screen, click **"Microsoft Excel"** if you saved the dataset as an Excel file or **"Text File"** if it's a CSV.
3. Locate your dataset file (Superstore_Lab1.csv or Excel).
4. Click **Open**.

---

### ‚úÖ **Step 2: Load the Data into Tableau**

1. Tableau will automatically load the data into the **Data Source** tab.
2. Verify that all columns are loaded correctly (e.g., Sales, Profit, Region, etc.).
3. Click **Sheet 1** at the bottom to start creating your report.

---

### ‚úÖ **Step 3: Create a Sales by Region and Category Report**

1. Drag **Region** to the Columns shelf.
2. Drag **Category** to the Rows shelf.
3. Drag **Sales** to the **Text** shelf (in Marks card).
4. Drag **Profit** to **Color** on the Marks card.
5. Change the **Marks Type** from Automatic to **Square**
   - This will give you a profit heat map on top of the Sales bars.

Double tap in sheet 1 and rename it as **Sales by Region and Category**

---

### ‚úÖ **Step 4: Add Quantity to Tooltip**

1. Drag **Order Quantity** to the **Tooltip** section in the Marks card.
2. Hover over any bar to view interactive tooltips showing **Region**, **Category**, **Sales**, **Profit**, and **Order Quantity**.

---

### ‚úÖ **Step 5: Add Filters**

1. Drag **Customer Segment** to the **Filters** shelf.
2. Select all segments for now.
3. Right-click the filter on the right panel and click **Show Filter**.
   - This will allow users to dynamically filter the report by Customer Segment.

---

### ‚úÖ **Step 6: Formatting**

1. Go to **Format** > **Shading**.
   - Change the background to white.
2. Adjust the color scheme for Profit (Optional).
   - Click on the color legend and select a diverging color palette.
3. Adjust label fonts to make the report look cleaner.

---

### ‚úÖ **Step 7: Save Your Workbook**

1. Click **File** > **Save As**.
2. Name it: `Lab1_Sales_Overview.twbx`.
3. Save it in your project folder.

---

### ‚úÖ **Step 8: Deliverable**

Export your interactive report as a PDF and also submit the `.twbx` Tableau workbook file.

Great! Let's continue **Lab 1** by adding more interactive reports using the Superstore dataset. So far, we've built:

1. **Sales by Category**
2. **Profit by Region**
3. **Quantity by Customer Segment (with filters)**

Now let's add more visualizations to make Lab 1 more comprehensive and interactive.

### ‚úÖ **Report 4: Sales vs. Profit Scatter Plot (Colored by Category)**

**Objective**: Understand how profit and sales are correlated across different product categories.

5. Drag `Item` to **Detail** (to make each dot represent a product).
6. Optional: Add `Item` to Tooltip to view item names on hover.
7. Format axis titles and adjust the tooltip formatting.

### ‚úÖ **Report 5: Sales by State (Map View)**

**Objective**: Visualize geographical sales performance.

**Steps**:
1. Create a new worksheet and name it **Sales by State Map**.
2. Drag `State` to **Rows** (Tableau will recognize it as a geographic field).
3. Drag `Sales` to **Color** and **Label** on the Marks card.
4. Change the Marks type to **Map**.
5. Use the **Color Legend** to highlight states with high and low sales.
6. Add `Category` as a filter if you want users to view map sales per category.

### ‚úÖ **Report 6: Top 10 Customers by Profit**

**Objective**: Identify customers contributing the most profit.

**Steps**:
1. Create a new worksheet called **Top 10 Customers**.
2. Drag `Customer Name` to **Rows**.

### ‚úÖ **Dashboard Creation: Lab 1 Dashboard**

Let‚Äôs combine all visualizations into a dashboard.

   - Sales by Category
   - Profit by Region
   - Quantity by Segment
   - Sales vs. Profit
